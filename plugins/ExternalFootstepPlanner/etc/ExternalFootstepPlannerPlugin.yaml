  # Skipped requests are to be expected given that the planner currently has no way to cancel the current requests computation
  # In practice this happens:
  # - When sending multiple requests in a row by moving the GUI target
  # - When sending multiple requests through continuous joystick use
  # In this case the latest request will be picked up once the previous requested plan has completed, and all other requests in between will be ignored.
